# Copy Taxonomy Bound to Taxonomy Helper Sheet  

There are two script files. The onEdit runs a script that clears out previous values for the dropdowns when searching for an atomic tag. 
The CopyTaxonomy.js runs once a day to copy over the certified curriculum taxonomy data to a tab on the Helper sheet. It also deletes some unneeded header rows and all the columns that aren't V3 of the taxonomy.
